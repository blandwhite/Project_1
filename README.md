## Executive Summary ??

### Background  

*DESCRIBE THE USER STORY AND ANY ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA*

---

## What's Being Created

In this Project, we will create and submit the following deliverables:

 - A Jupyter notebook that contains the following:

    1. An extraction of data from a `.csv` file; preparation of that data and analysis of that data using the Monte Carlo simulation.

    2. Professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations.

 - A video of the web application that has been created by deploying our Jupyter notebook via the Voil√† library.

## Technologies

This application is written in Python 3.7 using JupyterLab version 3.0.14.

Python libraries used:

 - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) - *an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.*
 - [Pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/pathlib.html) - *a library that enables consistent input and output of files from the main app.*
 - [MCSimulation](MCForeCastTools.py) - *a Python class for runnning Monte Carlo simulation on portfolio price data.*
 - [hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/user_guide/Introduction.html) - *a high-level plotting API for the PyData ecosystem built on HoloViews.*
 - [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) - *an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings.*
 - [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) - *a lightweight data-interchange format inspired by JavaScript object literal syntax.*
 - [OS](https://www.educba.com/python-os-module/) - *an interface between the Python Programming Language and the Host Operating System.*
 - [Alpaca Trade API](https://pypi.org/project/alpaca-trade-api/) - *a python library for the Alpaca Commission Free Trading API. It allows rapid trading algo development easily, with support for both REST and streaming data interfaces.*
  - [playsound](https://pypi.org/project/playsound/) - *a pure Python, cross platform, single function module with no dependencies for playing sounds.*


### Installation Guide

prior to running these libraries, install them from the command line:  
  - pandas: `conda install pandas` or `pip install pandas`  
  - pathlib: `pip install pathlib`
  - MCSimulation: include `MCForecastTools.py` in root directory.
  - hvPlot: `conda install -c pyviz hvplot` or `pip install hvplot`
  - requests: `python -m pip install requests`
  - alpaca-trade-api: `pip install alpaca-trade-api`
  - playsound: `from playsound import playsound`
  - JSON: `conda install -c jmcmurray json`

## Next Steps

   *1. Take a moment to discuss potential next steps for the project.*

   *2. Discuss any additional questions that came up that you didn't have time to answer: if you had more weeks to work on your project, what would you research next?*
